Not only is this a great motivating factor for us as a company; it means that there is absolutely zero up-front risk for our property owning clients. Simply put: we don't get paid until you do. Why, you ask? Because we want you, the client, to feel comfortable with us managing your properties. As an added safety measure for our clients, each listing is covered for up to $1 million dollars worth of damages. We want you to sleep soundly at night knowing that, at the end of the day, your property is in good hands.</p>
